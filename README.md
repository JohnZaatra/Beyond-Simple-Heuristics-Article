# Pancake Problem Heuristic Search Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project tackles the Pancake Problem, a classic computational problem in artificial intelligence, using advanced heuristic search algorithms—A* and Adaptive Weighted A* (AWA*). The main objective of this project is to optimize search performance through the use of sophisticated heuristic combinations and dynamic weighting strategies. The outcome is a highly efficient solution that balances time, memory usage, and solution quality.  
This repository includes the complete implementation of the algorithms, alongside an in-depth research paper detailing the experimental setup, results, and conclusions. The research paper presents a systematic comparison of multiple heuristic functions and combination techniques, demonstrating the impact of each on the performance of A* and AWA* in solving the Pancake Problem.

## Key Features

- **Heuristic Search Algorithms**: Implementations of A* and AWA* algorithms, focusing on different heuristic functions like gap, breakpoint, and position-based heuristics.  
- **Heuristic Combinations**: Exploration of three main heuristic combination methods: Simple Averaging Heuristic (SAH), Weighted Averaging Heuristic (WAH), and Multi Averaging Heuristic (MAH).  
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Utilization of dynamic weight adjustment strategies (linear, exponential, piecewise) in the AWA* algorithm to optimize performance.  
- **Experimental Setup & Results**: Comprehensive experiments conducted across different pancake sizes, providing detailed analysis of performance metrics such as time, nodes expanded, solution cost, and memory usage.

## Why This Project Is Special

1. **Advanced Search Algorithms & Heuristic Design**  
   The Pancake Problem is a challenging combinatorial problem, and solving it efficiently requires smart search algorithms and heuristic functions. In this project, I didn't just implement the basic A* search algorithm—I explored complex heuristic combinations to optimize performance. By combining SAH, WAH, and MAH, I created powerful heuristics that significantly enhance both time efficiency and solution quality.

2. **Hands-On Experience with AI Research**  
   This project is backed by an academic research paper that I wrote, designed to be published. The paper is a structured, well-researched piece that analyzes the performance of different heuristic combinations and offers insights into optimizing heuristic search algorithms. This experience of conducting research, experimenting with real-world problem instances, and documenting findings has been a powerful learning opportunity, and it's something that truly sets this project apart.

3. **Real-World Applicability & Optimization Techniques**  
   The results of this project provide insights that go beyond academic exercises. For example, the dynamic weighting in AWA* and the use of advanced heuristic combinations offer practical solutions for real-time systems requiring fast and efficient decision-making, such as in robotics, planning, and AI-powered games. These optimization techniques can be directly applied to solve similar real-world search problems.

4. **Professional-Level Work**  
   The code in this repository is thoroughly organized, well-commented, and optimized for performance. The research paper is meticulously organized with clear experimental methodology, data analysis, and visualizations (graphs, tables). Writing this article and undertaking such a detailed experiment reflects a high level of discipline, analytical thinking, and the ability to handle complex AI topics. It showcases not only my technical skills but also my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, an essential skill for any research or development role.
